# known-pinboard

Post bookmarks from Known (withknown.com) to Pinboard (pinboard.in), IndieWeb style.

This plugin adds a syndication option to send your bookmarks to the fabolous Pinboard social bookmarking service after posting them on your own Known site. It uses the Pinboard API (using TLS) for this.

Currently it supports creating bookmarks and including tags and a detailed description (taking from your Known entry). There seem to be some encoding issues left, though.

This plugin was heavily inspired by [Tim Owens' Diigo plugin](https://github.com/timmmmyboy/Diigo), thanks for your awesome work!
